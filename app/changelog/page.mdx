# Changelog

## Version 1.0.0 - 01.02.2025

### Calibration
- Add DFX file export
- Add user preferences window
- Add auto rerun on settings change. Changes to UI are planned to display processed steps immediately instead of waiting for all to completed
- Add "Additional Settings" to preferences window. These are the same setting from "Detailed Settings", but in a convenient place 
- Moved "Detailed Settings" to a smaller icon button next to preferences

### Bug Fixes
- Fix US Legal paper size to include decimal places in mm measurement
- Fix hole detection so they are not overlapping or nested.

## 30.01.2025

### Bug fixes

- Fix image upload issue when there aren't previous images
- Fix loading screen when navigating from details form to calibration screen
- Fix upload image button opening twice
- Fix error when deleting paper selection index in calibration

## 29.01.2025

**Note:** Existing contours, svg export and their references to models will be broken and throw errors. To fix them simply rerun the calibration.

- Allow to select paper outline from all found options
- Support for finding contours for multiple objects
- Improve calibration screen to make it a bit more user friendly.

### Bug fixes and Improvements

- Add name edit field to contour calibration screen
- Add preview to contour import in editor
- Add contours id to the calibration URL
- Clean up raw image data from contours. Existing contours will still have the data.
- Scale along normals in small increments of `0.01` to mitigate errors of outline being inverted. Should probably need a better fix.
