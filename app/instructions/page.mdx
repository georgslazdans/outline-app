## <a name="quick-start"> Quick Start </a>

### 1. Set up environment

Place a paper on a flat surface that has good contrast with the paper. Ensure the lighting is consistent and avoid reflections as much as possible.

<ExportedImage
  className="object-contain !relative max-h-[30vh]"
  src={paperOnTable}
  alt={"A4 Paper on a brown table"}
  priority
  fill
></ExportedImage>

### 2. Place objects on top of a paper sheet

Place a object or multiple objects on top of the A4 paper. Make sure the object is centered and not touching the edges of the paper.

  src={caliperOnPaper}
  alt={
    "Digital caliper placed on top of the A4 paper which is on a brown table"
  }
  priority
  fill
></ExportedImage>

### 3. Take picture

Take a picture of the setup, ensuring the entire paper and object are visible and centered in the frame. Use the camera's highest resolution to capture as much detail as possible.

<ExportedImage
  className="object-contain !relative max-h-[50vh]"
  src={detailsForm}
  alt={
    "Details form for digital caliper with name field, orientation, and paper size"
  }
  priority
  fill
></ExportedImage>

### 4. Adjust settings

Adjust the settings for detecting the paper and object. Fine-tuning these parameters will help in accurately outlining the object.

#### Paper Detection

By changing the settings under **Find Paper** find the blue paper outline.

- **Bilateral Filter Pixel Diameter:** Adjust the pixel size to reduce noise in the image. For very noisy pictures a high value will help finding outlines at the cost of performance.
- **Blur Size:** Adjust the blur size to reduce noise in the image.
- **Block Size:** Set the block size for adaptive threshold.
- **Select Paper Outline:** If there are multiple squares found in the picture, this setting changes which of them is the paper.

#### Object Detection

By changing the settings under **Find Object** along with **Close Corners** find the red object outlines.

- **Blur Size:** Similar to paper detection, adjust the blur size to help identify the object.
- **Threshold Type:** Sets threshold type. For pictures with high contrast "Binary" threshold will give more accurate results.
- _Adaptive:_ Filters the image by finding outlines
  - **Block size:** Set the block size for adaptive threshold.
- _Binary:_ Filters the image by set values
  - **Threshold:** Set the lower threshold value.
  - **Inverse Threshold:** Set the upper threshold value.

**Note**: Blur size is only available, if **`Extract Paper`** has **`Reuse Step`** set to **`None`**. **`None`** is the default value.

#### Close Corners

Helps with outlines where there are gaps. Larger values close more gaps, but introduces inaccuracy in resulting outline.

- **Kernel Size (px):** Define the kernel size for morphological operations.
- **Iterations:** Set the number of iterations for closing corners. Set `0` for skipping this step.

#### Hole Settings and Smoothing

- **Max Background Difference:** Adjust to distinguish between the object and background.
- **Area Size Threshold:** Set the minimum area size to identify holes.
- **Smoothing Strength:** Set the contour smoothing to reduce unnecessary points in the outline. A value of `0` is not recommended.

#### Filter Objects

Select which contours will be exported and available in editor.

**Note**: After selecting contours "Rerun" should be pressed to apply selected contours.

## <a name="environment-setup">Environment Setup</a>

Setting up the environment perfectly will save a lot of time adjusting settings later.

### <a name="basic-setup">Basic Setup</a>

- Ensure your lighting is consistent.
- Avoid reflections as much as possible to get a clear image.
- Zoom in when taking the photo to minimize distortion.

### <a name="recommended-setup">Recommended Setup</a>

For easiest and most accurate results, it's recommended to use a transparent backlight source, e.g. giant tablet, monitor or glass/plastic sheet with lights under.
Calibration then is straightforward by using "Binary" threshold in **Find Object** and using low **Blur Size** and **Close Corners** values for the best accuracy.

## <a name="detailed-settings">Detailed Settings</a>

### <a name="bilateral-filter">Bilateral Filter</a>

Applies a bilateral filter to the image to reduce noise while keeping edges sharp. Can be disabled to improve performance.

- **Disabled** - Checkbox to enable or disable the filter.
- **Pixel Diameter** - Diameter of each pixel neighborhood used during filtering. Higher values yield better results, but increase processing time.
- **Sigma Color** - Filter sigma in the color space. A larger value means that farther colors within the pixel neighborhood will be mixed together.
- **Sigma Space** - Filter sigma in the coordinate space. A larger value means that farther pixels will influence each other as long as their colors are close enough.

For more details, see the [OpenCV Bilateral Filter documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/4.10.0/d4/d86/group__imgproc__filter.html#ga9d7064d478c95d60003cf839430737ed).

### <a name="gray-scale">Gray Scale</a>

Converts the input image to grayscale, reducing it to a single color channel.

### <a name="blur-setting">Blur</a>

Blurs the image to reduce noise and details.

- **Blur Size** - The size of the kernel used for blurring the image. Larger values result in a more blurred image.

For more details, see the [OpenCV Gaussian Blur documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d4/d86/group__imgproc__filter.html#gae8bdcd9154ed5ca3cbc1766d960f45c1).

### <a name="adaptive-threshold">Adaptive Threshold</a>
