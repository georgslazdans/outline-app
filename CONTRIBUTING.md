## How to Contribute

### Found an Issue

Feel free to create a new GitHub issue or fix it yourself by creating a Pull Request.

### Creating Pull Requests

Pull requests should target `develop` instead of `master`. Any changes merged into master redeploys the application. Before deploying the application, I would like to run the single UI test and create the changelog after testing the changes.

This might be automated when there are more contributions to this repository.
